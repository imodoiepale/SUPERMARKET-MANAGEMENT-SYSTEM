# JUMIA STOCK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In this Project We will create a Vb.Net complete application of Grocery Shop Management. The Application starts with a nice looking splash form which leads to a login form. The login form will be connected to the database , if the user id and password match the  database, the user will login to the main form.
#
The Application has two Roles: Admin and User
<br>
The Admin can Save, Edit and Delete Items and Products.
<br>
The Employee can Sell Products and Print Bills.
